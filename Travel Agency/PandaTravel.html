        <p>"Awesome experience! We stayed at the Myrtles for our Honeymoon. Beautiful property! We had such a great time and enjoyed the delicious breakfast in the general store. We were also able to meet the famous Mrs. Hester and get her sweet hugs. We plan on staying again. Thanks for a truly great time!"-Anna</p><br/>
        <p>"Haunted or not, this place deserves to be the center of any vacation tour of the South. We loved just sitting and enjoying a quiet evening experiencing the Myrtles Plantation. It was the most friendly staff I can say I have seen in a long time. Every one went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and welcome."-Michael S.</p>
